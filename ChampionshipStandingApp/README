Championship Standings Predictor

I built this application to imagine and simulate possible outcomes of a championship by predicting match results and viewing the evolving standings.

Goal

This tool allows you to:
- Start with an initial set of team scores
- Add predicted match results
- Automatically update the standings in real time

It’s a lightweight way to explore “what if” scenarios for a sports league.

Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: AngularJS
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: MongoDB

Features

- Retrieves initial standings and match results from MongoDB
- Allows users to input new matches with scores
- Saves new match results to the database
- Updates team points live and re-sorts standings accordingly
- Material Design styling for a modern UI

How to use it:
start the server: node server.js
Open the frontend in your browser localhost:3000

Data Structure
Teams: { name: String, points: Number }

Matches: { team1: String, score1: Number, team2: String, score2: Number }
