in aerodynamics, there are several simplified equations to describe the relationship between air pressure and velocity over a wing, especially under steady, incompressible flow conditions. The most common is:

✅ Bernoulli’s Equation (Simplified Form)
For incompressible, non-viscous, steady flow, Bernoulli’s equation is:

𝑃

𝜌

Where:

𝑃
P = static pressure (Pa)

𝜌
ρ = air density (kg/m³)

𝑣
v = flow velocity (m/s)

🧠 Key Insight for a Wing:
If air moves faster over the top of a wing than underneath (due to the shape or angle), then:

Top Surface:

Higher velocity → lower pressure

Bottom Surface:

Lower velocity → higher pressure

This pressure difference creates lift.

🧪 Example:
Let’s say:

Air density 
𝜌

ρ=1.225kg/m

Negative result → pressure is lower on top → lift is generated.
